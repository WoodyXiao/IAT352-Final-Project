In university he studied chemistry at San Diego State College for two years but dropped out and moved in 1966 to the Bay Area, pursuing a life in the arts. He trained as a commercial photographer at Laney College in Oakland, before emigrating to Vancouver in 1970 as a refugee from the violence of America and as the fulfillment of a promise to his grandfather to someday return to the land of his ancestors.His first Canadian job as photo-technician for the Vancouver Public Library Historical Photograph Section, provided an immersion into Vancouver’s visual history and introduced him to the work of photographer Mattie Gunterman. In 1976 he left the world of archives and researched Mattie Gunterman’s life, producing an exhibition of her work that toured 26 venues and led to the 1995 publication of her historical biography, Flapjacks &amp; Photographs.In 1980 he launched a decade-long project The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, crisscrossing Canada in search of monumental human activity and the true meaning of Canada. After producing a series of sixty large scale black and white panoramic photographs he moved to Montreal in 1987 to work on the eastern side of the Survey. On July 14, his second day in Montreal, his panoramas were destroyed in a flood. His lost work was later celebrated in the publication Canada’s Gigantic! Four years in Montreal came to an end with attending the events at Oka, followed by a trip to Japan he’d been putting off since he was 9. The Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey went largely unfinished after amassing more than 1500 panoramas, but out of it came 500 Fun Years a narrative on Colonialism done for the 1992 500th anniversary of resistance.In 1991 he moved back to Vancouver working for Green Peace photographer Robert Keziere out of Jack Shadbolt’s old studio on Cambie Street providing photographic services and productions for Canada’s leading artists, galleries and publications. He also taught photography at Emily Carr College of Art as a sessional for the next 25 years. For the past thirty years his practice has been in the form of multi panel photographic montages with holographic text. Sometimes this work is an introspective reflection on the ironic tragedy of human existence, as is the case with the two series The Crossroads Of Life and Acts Of God. Other times history and politics provide the narrative as in the millennial snapshot, Four Directions of the Okanagan, and most recently the anecdotal account of 40 years of Vancouver development, Eraser Street.Henri Robideau’s photography has been exhibited and collected both in Canada and internationally.

(1, 'Captain George Vancouver', 'A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver\'s Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named.  Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting. An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley.  Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\" Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I\'ve been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there\'s nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\". Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don\'t want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\" Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don\'t know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\" The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city\'s 115th birthday.

In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown\'s initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. \"When I couldn\'t get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.\" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci\'s foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. \"Girl in Wetsuit\" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.', 79, 1972);

(430, 'Weathervane', 'Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham’s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to ‘ponder on horseback’  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham’s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer’s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a “treasure island”, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist’s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that ‘the trip is the thing’.

Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.  Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.  This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.

It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.

Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.  For Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective\'s inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like \"it doesn\'t have to be good to be meaningful and \"get social or get lost.\" It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver.   Instant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount.

My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.  The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place—the situation—the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art.   Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life.

Guest curated by  Charo Neville, Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that will be on view through the months of February  and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero’s project will be visible from the  street during the day through the window of Access Gallery.     Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of  light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a  completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created  from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the  viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offers a sense of  solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incites inevitable reflections  about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated.    As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his  experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his  homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the  paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to  their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive  on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero’s practice. The title of the work,  Passage, reflects these ideas – water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death.     This new work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country.  Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as “dream,”  “discover,” and “celebrate,” the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.

There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants’ video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.  Participation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics.   There is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April.

A reveal is typically the empty space at the bottom of a wall, where a measured gap is left so the floor and wall do not meet.  In this proposed photomural we will see how the saltwater rises twice a day, cutting an acutely accurate level in the tree boughs as they hang down from the forest landscape.

Since childhood, every time I’ve driven down it, I’ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south — by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother’s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.  I’ve been watching the strip’s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I’m glad it’s finally changing, I’ve been slightly unsure of what it’s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing — but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that’s just me being morbid. It’s now actually much better than it was before — the air of unipolar depression is gone — replaced by the early 21st century’s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, ‘Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?’  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.  Canadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires — the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that’s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems.\" - Douglas Coupland, 2012', 'Sculpture', 'In place', 'Canadian Tire', '26 South West Marine Drive', '', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/datasets/1.0/public-art/images/4fa66f210fc77ef34bf5760d07758e8d', 'Privately owned', 'Marpole', '', '', '', 391, 2012),

(542, 'Fish Ladder: Salmon in the Capilano', '\"When I was first asked to submit a concept for a public art piece to be installed at the Canada Line Station entrance at the intersection of Georgia and Granville Street, I visited the site. Of course I knew beforehand what the function of the entrance was, with its stairs and escalators. But knowing about the function of something versus experiencing it firsthand are different. The first leads to an objective, factual kind of understanding, while the latter leads one to a more poetic understanding in which analogous connections can come to mind. Seeing the toing and froing of commuters going up and down the stairs and escalators brough to my mind remembered experiences of salmon migrating up the Campbell River and its tributaries and the eventual return of new, young salmon downstream to the ocean. Seeing that event left me unexpectedly, strongly affected. I wanted to see if I might be able to bring some aspect of it into my work. So I began making a series of photographs at the Capilano Hatchery in North Vancouver. When the City of Vancouver Public Art Department approached me regarding the creation of a public artwork, I was in the early stages of collecting images of Salmon. But I had not yet reached a decision on how I would eventually employ these images. The Canada Line project brought this into focus for me.   I wanted whatever image I created for the Canada Line Station entrance to have a strong connection to the function of the site as well as to life on the Coast of British Columbia. I wanted viewers to be able to recognize and appreciate these connections. Further to this, I hoped to trigger people’s thoughts about these wild creatures and how they have exerted such a powerful effect on the rhythm of life along our coast throughout living memory as well as long before that. They have always been central in our cultures and economies.   I chose to represent the salmon swimming within a structure that recreates the look of a fish ladder rather than attempting to show them swimming in the wild. I believe this allows viewers to connect my image to the structure and function of the Canada Line entrance, hopefully in a whimsical way. However, the image structure is also meant to allude to our processes for studying the life cycle of salmon, controlling and promoting the continued, healthy reproduction of their various wild species, and ensuring continued future harvests.  These fish are full of vitality and a sense of undeterred purpose in the face of all obstacles. They are powerful swimmers that remain wild and mysterious, even when they find themselves channeled through our systems. I have tried to express some of these qualities by catching their images in moments when they are highly animated, swimming through turbulent water filled with swirling bubbles, their bodies dark and unknowable in their watery element.\" - Jim Breukelman, 2013', 'Mural', 'Removed', 'Canada Line Vancouver City Centre Stn (Downtown)', 'Georgia and Granville (Downtown)', 'Solid Vinyl sheets - images; Perforated Vinyl - image borders.

(573, 'Giants Among Us', 'Giants Among Us is my response to the role of reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and Settlers to this land. Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.  The image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor.   The second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her “Skwanee.” She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.  The third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P\'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.  The final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.  Although I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice.

(591, 'Substation Pavilion', 'Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely a decoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver’s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion’s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious something else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure? Substation Pavilion’s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ‘reclaiming’ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them, creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that contains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a year with its short-lived mushroom heads.

In the artist’s Lakota Sioux community they hold power as a source of sacred mana integral to ceremonial life.

In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don\'t see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away.

This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moiré. Alongside the use of digital moiré, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies. The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer’s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion. Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits. The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form.

(646, 'Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world', '“Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is the title of a text-and-image based work meant for installation at transit shelters. There is a certain fictional quality to the term “coastal city”, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. “From a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. “Ukiyo” is a Japanese term meaning “the floating world”, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver’s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean? Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline. From anecdotes predating the Galleon Trade1 to our present-day container cargo ships, our waterways and oceans tell the story of cultural exchange, some through trade while others through natural happenstance. “Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is both laden with truth and a work of fiction made possible through subjective and speculative storytelling. It epitomises how our coastline embodies our cultural makeup and experiences, and is a catalyst in triggering memories and starting conversations.

(647, 'Untitled, 2016', 'My project for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City further develops two of my areas of interest: the shifting relationship between the digital and the physical, and the material, political, and ecological tension between the natural world and human-centered activities. Situated in a sensitive geographic location, Vancouver maintains environmental responsibilities that have both local and widespread implications. The material traces of these consequences—from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water—are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic.  The project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season.  These references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works. The biomorphic abstractions and “textures” are generated by contact printing acrylic paint on translucent plastic film, or utilizing materials that would typically be considered waste (polypropylene drop sheets, shipping packaging, etc.). This uneasy union between synthetic materials produces curiously natural results—the fractal forms are reminiscent of everything from rock formations to cedar bark. In this way, I see the works as a form of temporal excavation, resuscitating the organic ancestries of these petroleum products, even alluding to the networks of transportation and commerce required to procure the materials. These allusions to the distant past, and the pre-historic life forms that died to fuel the future, are complicated by references to more recent imaging technology, such as Photoshopped drop-shadows.  As these works are made using a contact printing process, the prints are highly detailed and especially compatible with digital enlargement—their magnification revealing fractal forms not visible to the naked eye. Expanded to the size of transit shelter posters, the biomorphic ‘figures’ that populate my works approach human-scale, creating a unique form of engagement and experience. Particularly well suited to viewers in transit, the high contrast figure-ground compositions function as both graphically prominent from a distance, and visually complex on close viewing. This high fidelity fractal detail suggests the imagery of coastal scenery, while the ‘figures’, oscillating between plant-like and humanoid, point to the changing landscape as a consequence of human-centered activities. In this way, the works speak to Vancouver as both a coastal city and an important ecosystem, and allude to our responsibilities as we move within it.', 'Two-dimensional artwork', 'Removed', 'Transit shelters around the city', '', 'Inkjet printed backlit film', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/datasets/1.0/public-art/images/69ffd5ddb6bbe385b9527fca7b5425b1', 'City of Vancouver', '', '20 Transit Shelter advertisement locations', '', 'Ryan Peter’s images are created through a contact photo-printing process in which he uses acrylic paints, household chemicals, and industrial materials that would be considered waste, registering the traces on translucent plastic film.

Both the myth and experience of Vancouver as a ‘Coastal City’ connect with overarching ideas in Mallett’s practice; this new series of images is akin to her ongoing series Personhood, which pulls its imagery from covers of self-improvement texts popular in the ‘70s and ‘80s exploring the terrain of quasi-mysticism, personal empowerment, and commodity culture. Taking a form reminiscent of outdated posters, these works isolate elliptical statements on self-improvement and the nature of being in self-referential and critical ways. The Journey references what the artist describes as a ‘West Coast New-Age’ culture, with a specific focus on ideas of travel, movement, and transition. These works play with themes of ‘transit’ and the ‘Coastal City’ in direct response to the situation of the work in the transit shelter ad spaces around Vancouver, through alluding to this regionally specific ‘new-age’ sensibility as well as the commonly used metaphor of ‘the journey’ in self-help literature.The artist would like to thank Nigel Lew and Emiliano Sepulveda for their assistance in making this work.', 'Two-dimensional artwork', 'Removed', 'Transit shelters around the city', '', 'Ink on paper', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/datasets/1.0/public-art/images/3af7cae7a9931b400255608b330f69b2', 'City of Vancouver', '', 'Twenty transit shelter advertisement locations', '', 'Kyla Mallett’s transit shelter posters for the Coastal City project take the form of quasi-inspirational posters created from altered new-age book covers referring to a certain \"West Coast New-Age\" culture.', 306, 2016),

(655, 'Golden Tree', '\"I remember growing up and seeing photos of redwood stumps in northern California, photos in which, “Wow! You can drive a car right through it!” I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, “Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you’d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?” My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.       In 2006 Stanley Park’s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don’t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It’s where they had their first kiss; it’s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I’m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It’s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It’s rotting. It’s nature. So I wondered, “Why not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?” This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It’s a mirror of something that once was — and will still be for a little while — and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems. It’s also located at the Canada Line Station, and I realize for many people coming to Vancouver, they’ll see the Golden Tree before they see the Hollow Tree, as if reading the chapters in a book in the wrong order, and isn’t that life?\"', 'Sculpture', 'In place', '', '8018 - 8198 Cambie', '', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/datasets/1.0/public-art/images/90975f329f2a9d214762e078a4b12c13', 'City of Vancouver', 'Marpole', 'Corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street', '', '', 391, 2016),

The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka\'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother\'s Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw’u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T\'uy\'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces.

The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of “Head in the Hole” photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct, loosely translates as “we are one” in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as “one” across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ʻHead in holeʼ photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it.

(780, 'Building A - Livestock Building', 'Building A - Livestock Building is an infrared photograph of the 1929 Livestock Building located on the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds. The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of “all persons of Japanese racial origins,” from the west coast “protected area” of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled “enemy aliens,” were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners’ consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children’s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men’s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process. This image portrays the interior of the Livestock Building, with bedsheets dividing the living quarters.

(785, 'Mother and Child', 'My vision for Fraser Commons was a pair of bronze sculptures. Mother and Child focuses on the idea of the family and is sited at the heart of the new development in the public park adjacent to the new daycare centre. This pair of sculptures hopes to foster through its biomorphic shapes, tactile material and series of openings, social and physical activity by encouraging children, teens and adults to interact with the work. The proposed work echoes the Fraser Commons&rsquo; ambition to create a family friendly and calm inviting space from which to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Often regarded as the father of modern British sculpture, Henry Moore and his longtime friend, colleague and fellow sculptor Barbara Hepworth have been, time and again, a source of inspiration for my artistic work. In this instance, Mother and Child draws upon the artists&rsquo; use of abstraction of human and natural forms along with the recurring motif of the family. Like the work of Moore and Hepworth, the sculptures will be situated within the green space of the park and will act as a frame for the landscape.  Mother and Child is equally influenced by the post war &lsquo;play sculptures&rsquo; of British sculptor John Bridgeman (1916 &ndash; 2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon M&ouml;ller-Nielsen (1915 &ndash; 1959). Bridgeman and M&ouml;ller-Nielsen&rsquo;s play-sculpture hybrids are models for the work&rsquo;s sense of playfulness and will help to animate the space and humanize the architectural design of the new Fraser Commons.  The choice of traditional cast bronze is a nod to the works of these modernist masters, but is also motivated by my desire to encourage physical interaction, touching and movement through the works on the part of the viewer whose contact contributes to its changing patina. The sculpture&rsquo;s blue finish is informed by my childhood memories of the old Blue Boy Motel Hotel formerly located on the site. The colour provides something of an historical trace of the distinctive &lsquo;Wosk&rsquo; blue tiles which were a part of the Vancouver landscape for so long. The blue colour will also act as a beautiful counterpoint to the copper tones that are seen throughout Fraser Commons.  Mother and Child will invite interaction at the ground level of the community but will also have visual appeal when viewed from above. In its simplicity, the work will provide a focal point for the busy new hub of the Sunset community.', 'Sculpture', 'In place', 'Fraser Commons', '8188 Fraser Street', 'Bronze', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/datasets/1.0/public-art/images/c820d2163c43300fea48b0921a296fc3', 'Privately owned - Strata', 'Sunset', 'Sited on the southwest corner of the open public green space between Fraser Street and Chester Street', '{\"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [-123.090324, 49.211508]}', 'Mother and Child was commissioned by Serracan Properties Ltd as part of their participation in the City of Vancouver&#39;s Public Art Program for Private Development.', 561, 2021),

(803, 'Night Prowl', 'Deanna Bowen’s artistic practice concerns itself with histories of Black experience in Canada and the US. Her focus is the “dark matter” in our midst: people and events that remain just below the threshold of visibility, not because they are impossible to find but because they are difficult for the majority culture to acknowledge due to the systematized racism they expose. Mining overlooked archives, she asks difficult questions about who records history. She reactivates historic documents through a process of extraction, translation and enlargement, and then reinserts this material back into public consciousness in a new form. Over the past two years, Bowen has undertaken exhaustive research in Vancouver to trace a series of intertwined figures who formed an integral part of this city’s Black entertainment community from the 1940s to the end of the 1970s. She mapped a constellation of nightclubs, theatres and hotels where they gathered— many of which have been erased from the city’s physical fabric and its collective memory, but exist as traces in the archives. Her aim is to bring a more complex Black community into visibility, and to posit a powerful counterpoint to common narratives that oversimplify the city’s Black presence by containing it within the spatial, economic and temporal confines of Hogan’s Alley. Night Prowl captures part of a frame of filmed footage accompanying CBC reportage about Vancouver’s ethnically diverse east end nightclubs that aired on October 14, 1959. Racially-motivated anxieties around such nightclubs—and the neighbourhoods in which they were situated—would fuel the calls for urban renewal that would dramatically displace Black communities in the coming decades. The image, which depicts the neon marquee of a now-forgotten dance club after dark, is interrupted by a series of circular voids: visible fragments of batch numbers punched through the cellulose film at its time of manufacture. The holes are a banal artifact found at the end of any film reel. For Bowen, however, the ruptured cellulose reminds us of film’s fragile materiality, compromises its visual seamlessness and undermines our ability to trust photography’s seductive promise of “truth.” Considered this way, even blemished and seemingly insignificant documents can be rich repositories for unintended readings, and for questioning who has been charged with writing our histories, and why.Kimberly Phillips, Curator, Contemporary Gallery', 'Two-dimensional artwork', 'Removed', 'CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza', '700 Hamilton Street', 'Digital print on vinyl', 'https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/datasets/1.0/public-art/images/936aa62c8c70968739cf378deb169dd1', 'Vancouver Heritage Foundation', 'Downtown', 'On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver.', '{\"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [-123.114234, 49.279663]}', 'THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal City’s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as “Spectaculars.”When McGavin’s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbard’s bread, a “Spectacular” was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty’s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbard’s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavin’s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didn’t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavin’s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the “Spectacular” installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the “Spectacular” crew convened on the roof of McGavin’s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavin’s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanity’s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970’s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image.

The text begins in the upper right with the date and the number of covid cases worldwide at that moment in time. Its stream of consciousness writing, covers my concerns, preoccupations and thoughts around the pandemic, which eventually simultaneously becomes about the killing of George Floyd and concerns for the continued colonial erasures we enact on Indigenous communities, land and place. In the lower left, when the drawing was finished, the date and number of covid cases appears again thereby making the drawing a unique record of a place and time.

The work includes three distinct audio tracks, installed at specific locations within the plaza. Specialized directional speakers are integrated into the ceiling panels, producing a highly controlled sound &ldquo;column&rdquo; that visitors walk into and out of at will. Customized paving on the ground plane visually identifies the location of the work.  The audio tracks are a series of collaborative texts/stories, gleaned from fourteen writers from around the city that, when taken together, weave narratives that define lives lived in proximity: restlessness and care. Each speaker reveals a randomized program of short narratives that span past, present and future: the work invites listeners to explore the ideas of Restless Futures (Speaker A), Speculative Pasts (Speaker B) and Instructions for Care in the present (Speaker C). Owing to programming by Remy Siu and responsive sound design by Antoine B&eacute;dard, each speaker retains a constantly shifting presence; each listener experiences a unique sequence of narrative and sound.  The narratives are drawn from emerging and established writers, including Lorna Brown, Lili Robinson, Amber Dawn, Aryo Khakpour, James Long, Maiko Yamamoto, Whess Harman, Amiel Gladstone, Jus-tine A. Chambers, Cease Wyss, Vanessa Kwan, Hiromi Goto, Faith Sparrow-Crawford, and Tim Carlson.
